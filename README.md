Action-Driven Human-Oriented Compiler
=====================================

I. Intro:
---------
ADHOC is an application for abstracting programming logic away from
the syntax of any  particular language. The idea is that there is
some *important logic* that only a programmer can supply, but most
other program content is *syntactic fluff* for helping a textual
compiler understand the important logic. ADHOC supplies a graphical
interface and optimization tools in order to let the programmer
focus solely on designing important logic.
